UofT Full Stack Coding Bootcamp module 9 exercise.

## About This Repository
This repository contains the working files for the Coding Bootcamp module 9 exercise.<br>
The objective of this exercise is to implement a portfolio generator using Node.js. When the application starts, the user is asked a series of prompts about their profile and projects. By the end of the process, the aplication generates a single page portofolio with a brief description of each project and links to their github repositories. 

## Usage
Prepare the application by installing the npm packages: `npm install` and then run using `node app.js` from the root folder.
Answer the prompts to create the portfolio as required.
